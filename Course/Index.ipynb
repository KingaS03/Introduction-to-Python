    "This course is based on the book below and the corresponding Jupyter notebooks of *Jake VanderPlas*. The course in its original format can be found [on Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). As reading from and writing to a file is belonging also to the basics, Kinga Sipos created the complementray Chapter *15-File Input and Output*. Chapter *19-Plotting* was also added to provide a first experience with plotting in Python. Some other little details were created and/or changed. Finally extra exercises were added in order to enhance the interactivity of the course."
